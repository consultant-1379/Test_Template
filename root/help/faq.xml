            <title>What is a collection?</title>
            <p>
                A collections is a set of network objects created by a user. When a user requests a collection, they
                will receive a list of all objects in that collection with the latests details. Collections do not store
                the state of the objects at time of creation. If an object in a collection no longer exists, it will not
                be displayed in the list of objects.

            <p>
                This app is designed to work in modern browsers supporting HTML5 and related web standards. Not all
                features may work correctly in older browsers. We recommend Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) for
                stability.

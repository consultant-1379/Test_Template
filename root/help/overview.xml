           This application allows users to search through managed objects by FDN or Type.

           Users can save collections of objects or their search query by clicking "Save as...". They may then enter a
           name, select type, and click "Save".

           To find a collection or saved search, the user can click on the name in the sidebar. This will display the
           objects in the collection or saved search.
